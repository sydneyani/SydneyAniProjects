1. Email Header: Legitimate Email

Extracted Information:

Sender’s Domain: apple.com

Return Path: john.doe@apple.com (for security reasons email is changed to an example email)

Transmission Route: Normal routing from apple.com server

Result: Is this email spoofed? False

Reason: The domain matches the return path, and the transmission route is consistent with a legitimate email from apple.com.





2. Email Header: Spoofed Email

Extracted Information:

Sender’s Domain: trustedbank.com

Return Path: user@unrelateddomain.com

Transmission Route: Routing through several suspicious servers

Result: Is this email spoofed? True

Reason: The return path does not match the sender’s domain, and the transmission route is inconsistent with the expected route for trustedbank.com.





3. Email Header: Phishing Attempt

Extracted Information:

Sender’s Domain: secure-payment.com

Return Path: payment@secure-payment.com

Transmission Route: Normal routing from secure-payment.com server

Result: Is this email spoofed? True

Reason: Even though the domain and return path match, the domain secure-payment.com is flagged in the database as a known phishing site.





4. Email Header: Email with Technical Issues

Extracted Information:

Sender’s Domain: reputablecompany.com

Return Path: noreply@reputablecompany.com

Transmission Route: Unusual routing, possibly due to server issues

Result: Is this email spoofed? Uncertain

Reason: The unusual routing may be due to technical issues rather than spoofing, requiring further investigation.



Summary: These examples demonstrate how such a tool might analyze different types of email headers and provide results based on the extracted information and its comparison against known data. In a real implementation, the analysis would be more complex and detailed, considering various other factors and potential anomalies in email headers.
